This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug related to FlatList rendering issues when dealing with nested objects and a faulty keyExtractor function. The bug.js file showcases the problematic implementation, while bugSolution.js provides a corrected version with an improved keyExtractor. The problem arises when the keyExtractor relies on properties that might not guarantee uniqueness across all nested items, leading to incorrect rendering and unexpected visual behavior. The solution involves implementing a robust keyExtractor that ensures each item has a unique identifier, fixing the visual glitches and ensuring correct data display.
