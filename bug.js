This React Native bug is related to the usage of the FlatList component and its interaction with a specific type of data. When the data source contains nested objects and the keyExtractor function doesn't properly identify each item uniquely, the FlatList might render incorrectly, causing unexpected visual glitches or incorrect item rendering. This is often due to the keyExtractor function relying on a nested property that doesn't consistently produce unique keys across all data items.
